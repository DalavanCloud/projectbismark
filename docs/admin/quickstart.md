Welcome to BISmark! Start here.
===============================

### 1. Connect your BISmark router to the Internet

Follow the included Netgear Installation Guide to connect the BISmark router to
your home network and the Internet. You may connect the router to an existing
home router, but we prefer you connect it directly to your broadband modem.

### 2. Connect your computer to the BISmark router

You can connect to the BISmark router via wired ethernet or wireless, just like
most other home gateways. Your computer should be configured automatically by
DHCP. The default configuration of the BISmark router's LAN is as follows:

- IP address range: 192.168.142.0/24 (192.168.142.0-192.168.142.255)
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- Gateway: 192.168.142.1
- Wireless network name: "BISmark" (2.4 GHz 802.11bgn) and "BISmark5" (5 GHz
  802.11an)
- Wireless network password: `bismark123`

### 3. Configure your BISmark router

Start by visiting <http://myrouter.projectbismark.net> and clicking the
"Configure your router" link. The default username and password are:

- Username: `root`
- Password: `bismark123`

**You should change this password as soon as is practical** by navigating to
"System" > "Administration" in the configuration application.

**You should also change the passwords on the wireless network. Remember to
change passwords on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio interfaces** ("radio0" and
"radio1" under "Network" > "Wifi" in the configuration application).

After making any configuration changes, **be sure to click "Save & Apply" at the
bottom of the screen to ensure your changes take effect.**

### 4. Register your BISmark router

Before accessing the Internet using your BISmark router **we require that you
register your router**. All attempts to access the Internet will redirect to a
registration portal at <https://register.projectbismark.net>.

BISmark measurement indicator
-----------------------------

Your BISmark router periodically measures the performance of your Internet
connection. The router will light the amber WPS LED when a measurement is in
progress.
