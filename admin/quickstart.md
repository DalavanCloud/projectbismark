Welcome to BISmark! Start here.
===============================

This guide will help you set up and get started quickly with your BISmark
router.

This project is a work-in-progress. If you run into any problems with this
setup process, please contact us at <bismark-core@projectbismark.net>.

### 1. Connect your BISmark router to the Internet

Follow the included Netgear Installation Guide to connect the BISmark router to
your home network and the Internet. You may connect it inline with an existing
home router, but it is preferable to connect it directly to your broadband
modem.

### 2. Connect your computer to the BISmark router

You can connect to the BISmark router via wired ethernet or wireless, just like
most other home gateways. Your computer should be configured automatically by
DHCP. The default configuration of the BISmark router's LAN is as follows:

- IP address range: 192.168.142.0/24 (192.168.142.0-192.168.142.255)
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- Wireless network name: "BISmark" (2.4 GHz 802.11bgn) and "BISmark5" (5 GHz
  802.11an)
- Wireless network password: bismark123

You may change any of these settings by visiting the router configuration
application as described below.

### 3. Configure your BISmark router

Start by visiting http://192.168.142.1. You can learn more about the project
from this start page, as well as accessing the router configuration page by
clicking the "Configure your router" link. The default username and password
are:

- Username: root
- Password: bismark123


**You should change this password as soon as is practical.**

**You should also change the passwords on the wireless network. Remember to
change passwords on both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio interfaces** ("radio0" and
"radio1" under "Network" > "Wifi" in the configuration application).

After making any configuration changes, **be sure to click "Save & Apply" at the
bottom of the screen to ensure your changes take effect.**

Getting help

Please DO NOT contact Netgear customer support if you have problems with your
BISmark router. Netgear will be unable to help you because of the special
BISmark software running on the router. Please consult the documentation at
http://projectbismark.net or contact <bismark-core@projectbismark.net> and we
will do our best to help, though we cannot provide support for home networks,
computers, or applications.
