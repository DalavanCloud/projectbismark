The BISmark team is pleased to announce the release of our latest stable
firmware lancre (see below for pronunciation guide). The new release, which is
based on OpenWRT's latest stable release Attitude Adjustment, offers
improvements in usability, security, and in deploying experiments. Among the
major highlights are a registration package that allows users to register with
Georgia Tech for better trouble shooting and support, stable wireless, support
for newer hardware, and better security with signed package repositories.

The team would like to acknowledge the support of volunteers and early adopters
in making this release possible.

Please contact us at bismark-core@projectbismark.net with any issues, comments,
or suggestions.

Pronunciation guide: Following on from the tradition set by klatch and quirm,
lancre is named after a location in Discworld [1]. Although "lanker" is
acceptable, we prefer to call it "lawnkruh" (with or without the guttural
consonant) in honor of its genesis in the bowels of Paris over the summer of
2013. "lankre" is definitely out, upon pain of being cast into Deepest Klatch
for all eternity.

Getting lancre:
Already have a BISmark router? You can install the upgrade yourself, or
we can do it for you if you give us permission. Full details are at
https://github.com/projectbismark/projectbismark/wiki/Upgrading-to-lancre

If you don't have a BISmark router, you can purchase a Netgear
WNDR3700v2 or WNDR3800  or a TP-Link WDR3600 and follow the instructions for installing the
BISmark firmware at
https://github.com/projectbismark/projectbismark/wiki/BISmark-firmware-installation

We may be able to send you a router if you live in an 'interesting' area
or have an 'interesting' ISP. We have a lot of routers in California and Georgia 
with Comcast, so if you match that profile, send us a note, we may send you a router
depending on our current deployment status. Sign up at http://goo.gl/bxBB0
